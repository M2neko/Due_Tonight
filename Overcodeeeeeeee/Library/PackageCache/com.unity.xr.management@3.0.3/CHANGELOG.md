* Add ability for users to disable auto initialize at start. This should allow for hybrid applications that want to start in non-XR mode and manually switch.
* Fix play mode initialization so that we can guarantee that XR has been initialized (or at least attempted initialization) by the time the Start method is called on MonoBehaviours.
* Documentation updated to cover the above.
* Fixed a bug in the new Readme script code that caused a crash in headless mode. Seems the code was launching an Editor window and causing UIElements to crash on an attempt to repaint. We have a workaround to make sure we don't load the window if in headless mode and a bug is filed with the responsible team to correct the crash.

* Streamlining of the management system. Move XR Manager to a singleton instance on XRGeneralSettings that is populated by an XRManagerSettings instance that the user can switch in and out. __NOTE: This removes the ability to use XRManagement for per scene situations. For hybrid or manual scenes the user will be responsible for instantiating/loading the XRManagerSettings instance they want and dealing with lifecycle themselves.__

## [2.0.0-preview.6] - 2019-3-29

## [0.1.0-preview.6] - 2018-07-17

### Added runtime tests for XRManager

### Updated code to reflect name changes for XR Subsystem types.

## [0.1.0-preview.5] - 2018-07-17

### Simplified settings for build/runtime

Since we are 2018.3 and later only we can take advantage of the new PlayerSettings Preloaded Assets API. This API allows us to stash assets in PLayerSettings that are preloaded at runtime. Now, instead of figuring out where to write a file for which build target we just use the standard Unity engine and code access to get the settings we need when we need them.

## [0.1.0-preview.4] - 2018-07-17

### Added samples and abiity to load settings

This change adds a full fledged sample base that shows how to work with XR Management from start to finish, across run and build. This includes serializing and de-serializing the settings.

## [0.1.0-preview.3] - 2018-07-17


## [0.1.0-preview.2] - 2018-06-22

### Update build settings management

Changed XRBuildData froma class to an attribute. This allows providers to use simpler SO classes for build data and not forece them to subclass anything.
Added a SettingsProvider subclass that wraps each of these attribute tagged classes. We use the display name from the attribute to populate the path in Unified Settings. The key in the attribute is used to store a single instance of the build settings SO in EditorBuildSettings as a single point to manage the instance.
Added code to auto create the first SO settings instance using a file panel since the Editor build settings container requires stored instances be backed in the Asset DB. There is no UI for creating the settings (unless added by the Provider) so this should allow us to maintain the singleton settings. Even if a user duplicates the settings instance, since it won't be in the Editor build settings container we won't honor it.

## [0.1.0-preview.1] - 2018-06-21

### This is the first release of *Unity Package XR SDK Management*.
